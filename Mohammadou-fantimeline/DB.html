                <li>Bergkamp plays for Ajax through its youth system; joining at age 11</li>
                <li> Bergkamp scores his first senior goal for the club against HFC Haarlem on 22 February 1987 in a match Ajax won 6–0</li>
                <li>He goes on to make 23 appearances in the 1986–87 season, including a European debut against Malmö FF in the 1986–87 European Cup Winners' Cup, earning him praise.</li>

                <li>Bergkamp agreed a £7.1 million move to the latter club in a deal which included his Ajax teammate Wim Jonk.</li>
                <li>Bergkamp made his debut against Reggiana on 29 August 1993 at the San Siro in a 2–1 victory.[20] He scored his first goal for the club against Cremonese in September 1993 but had a difficult time against the highly organised and resolute Italian defences, scoring a further seven goals in the league.</li>
                <li>Bergkamp endured a disappointing campaign, troubled with stress injuries and fatigue from the 1994 World Cup. He managed to score five goals in 26 appearances. </li>
                <li>Because of his poor performance on the pitch, one Italian publication renamed their award given to the worst performance of the week, L'asino della settimana (Donkey of the Week) to Bergkamp della settimana.[</li>

                <div class="bullets">
                <li>As Moratti prepared to make wholesale changes at the club, Bergkamp left Inter and signed with Arsenal in June 1995 for a transfer fee estimated at £7.5 million.[29] He became manager Bruce Rioch's first signing at Arsenal and broke the club's transfer fee record set at £2.5 million</li>
                <li>Became major contributor to Arsenal's return to success after much decline in the mid-1990s. On the opening day of the 1995–96 league season, Bergkamp made his full debut against Middlesbrough. He struggled to adapt to the English game and failed to score in the club's next six league matches, prompting ridicule by the national press.</li>
                <li> Became the club's top scorer with 22 goals and recorded a strike rate of 0.57. Arsenal's achievement was all the more astonishing given that the team, written off by many in December 1997, had made ground on reigning Premier League champions Manchester United</li>
